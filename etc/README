This directory gives some pam-script examples.  To use these scripts
they must be placed in the directory indicated by "configure --sysconfdir",
which is usually /etc/pam-script, and symbolic links need to be made to
conform to the acceptable list of scripts that are invoked by pam-script:
	pam_script_auth
	pam_script_acct
	pam_script_passwd
	pam_script_ses_open
	pam_script_ses_close

logscript:
Simply records the PAM_* environment variables and the pam_script.so
arguments to /tmp/pam-script.log.
It's useful to observe which stages are executed and by whom.
However, if the script is modified to show PAM_AUTHTOK, this exposes
the raw password text.

tally:
A pam-script version of the pam-tally module, supporting some of the same
options: deny, lock_time, unlock_time, magic_root, and even_deny_root_account.
The other options are ignored.
The script itself is written in perl and keeps the info in a database,
/tmp/pam-script-tally.*.  Use the tally script to query, set, or reset
items.  Run "tally -h" for further info.
Set the following symbolic links pointing to tally
	pam_script_auth
	pam_script_acct

The default behavior for pam-script is to fail if a needed script is
missing for the corresponding module-type.

To try out the pam-script.so module and the logscript program with the
various module-types, it's easiest to edit the individual common service
configuration files.

For Ubuntu/Debian:
	cat >>/etc/pam.d/common-account <<!
account	optional	pam_script.so
!
	cat >>/etc/pam.d/common-auth <<!
auth	optional	pam_script.so
!
	cat >>/etc/pam.d/common-password <<!
password	optional	pam_script.so
!
	cat >>/etc/pam.d/common-session <<!
session	optional	pam_script.so
!

For RedHat/Fedora:
	cat >> /etc/pam.d/system-auth <<!
account		optional	/lib/security/$ISA/pam_script.so
auth		optional	/lib/security/$ISA/pam_script.so
password	optional	/lib/security/$ISA/pam_script.so
session		optional	/lib/security/$ISA/pam_script.so
!

The RedHat system-auth is generated by authconfig, so these changes will
vanish unless measures are taken.

For this case, pam_script.so is optional so any failures should not affect
the rest of the PAM stack.  However, be careful though.  A mistake could
render your system inoperable and you may not be able to login easily to fix
the errant PAM configuration.

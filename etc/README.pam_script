The pam_script tool
-------------------

Pam-script confusingly provides the pam_script tool for running generic
pam-script programs in ./pam-script.d/ or for performing some basic
administrative functions like creating or removing symbolic links to
a pam-script enabled script or program.  Read the other READMEs or man
pages for further info regarding the attributes of a pam-script program.
This README will focus on the pam_script tool and its role in the
pam-script universe.

The pam_script tool serves two purposes.  Primarily running scripts
in ./pam-script.d/, and secondly, managing the symbolic links in
./pam-script.d/ or elsewhere of the various PAM module-types.

The various PAM module-types are:
	auth		- authorization
	acct		- account
	passwd		- password changes
	ses_open	- session start
	ses_close	- session end

If the pam_script tool is set-up with the various symbolic links as
described in the README, then it will run the appropriate scripts
in the ./pam-script.d/ directory.  For example, say the PAM stack
invoked pam-script with a PAM module-type of acct, then pam-script
will run pam_script_acct, which is a symbolic link to pam_script.
The pam_script tool sees that it was called as pam_script_acct and
then runs all scripts in ./pam-script.d/ that end with _acct.
Then returns 0 if all ran successfully, else 1 if any one of them
failed with a non-zero return status.

In addition, pam_script will set the PAM_SCRIPT_STATUS environment
variable with the overall exit status so far, so the script can 
choose whether to perform it's action or not.  If PAM_SCRIPT_STATUS
is already non-zero then there may be no point to run any further.
However, some scripts may need to be run whether the PAM_SCRIPT_STATUS
is non-zero or not.

Also, the command line arguments passed to pam-script (in the
pam-script.conf) are also passed on to all the scripts invoked from
within ./pam-script.d/.

Link Administration
-------------------

The pam_script tool can create all or some of the needed symbolic
links.  The goal is to allow a third party package to drop a script
or program in ./pam-script.d/, then create the set of symbolic links
within the same directory so it may become part of the PAM stack
via pam-script without the necessity of crafting a full PAM module.

The program dropped into ./pam-script.d/ should check how it is called
and act accordingly.  Check the provided example scripts, on how to
do this.

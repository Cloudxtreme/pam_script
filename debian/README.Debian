pam-script for Debian
---------------------

The pam-script module is placed in /lib/security/
and the scripts are in /etc/pam-script/
to include pam-script.so edit /etc/pam.d/common-*

Run script -c "dpkg-buildpackage" as root
in the source directory above this one.

You will need the debhelper, libpam0g-dev packages.

Look at the content list of the deb file with "dpkg -c"
